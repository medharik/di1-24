                Listing out tags, hashtags, and similar long lists of metadata as part of a piece of content is a difficult design problem, since a particular piece of content can sometimes be accompanied by dozens of tags (or more!)

            <br>
            <p>
                may have vastly different numbers of tags associated with them, which makes it difficult to easily align them visually, and impossible to fit them into a predefined region.
